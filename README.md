# Job Tracker App

The Job Tracker App is a full-stack application built to help users keep track of their job applications. It allows users to sign up, search for jobs, and apply for jobs, as well as manage their application status.

## Overview

The Job Tracker App is a simple and easy-to-use application that enables users to search and apply for jobs while keeping track of their application status. The app provides an intuitive interface that lets users easily manage their job applications, including details such as the job title, company name, application date, application status, and any notes or comments. The app also allows users to search for jobs based on keywords and location, and apply for jobs directly within the app.

## Description

The Job Tracker App is built using a full-stack development approach, with a front-end and a back-end component. The front-end is built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the back-end is built using Python, Flask, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy.

The app's front-end provides a clean and user-friendly interface that enables users to easily navigate the app's features. The home page displays a login and sign up form, and upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the dashboard. The dashboard displays all the user's job applications, including details such as the job title, company name, application date, and application status. Users can also add notes and comments to each application.

The back-end of the app is built using Python, Flask, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy. Flask is a lightweight web application framework that provides tools and libraries for building web applications quickly and efficiently. SQLite is a lightweight and efficient database management system that is used to store and retrieve user data. SQLAlchemy is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a high-level interface for interacting with databases.
